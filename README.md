# CoinIPNendpoint
Example endpoints for IPN notification from the CoinIPN crypto service


These very simple examples show you how to use CoinIPN.com's service to receive and register a payment event and updates. These examples are not complete plugins or libraries; the service is very simple to use, even when using a single PHP endpoint. 

More documentation to come when the first files are updated.
